# Server_side
This is a repo for Server-Side Web Applications Development Course.

It should be used with the assignment_db database that should be hosted in Xampp or any other supported database services.

**Note: assignment_db.sql should be imported into phpMyAdmin before use it (create a database named as "assginment_db" before importing assginment_db.sql into phpMyAdmin).

Pre-Settings:
Open your xampp service and run Apache & MySQL simultaneously, only proceed to the Admin of MySQL.

Step 1:
Download and unzip the folder to your localhost (C:/xampp/htdocs).

Step 2:
Search "http://localhost/Gadget-Accessories-Store" using Google Chrome.

You're now good to use it! This webiste comprises the logically normal CRUD operations and a simple interface.
